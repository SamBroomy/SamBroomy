# Sam Broomy

Minimalist engineer, builder, and explorer.

## About

I'm a machine learning engineer with a strong data science background (4 years professional ML, 7+ years Python). These days, I spend most of my time writing Rust. I've built several Rust projects focused on real systems, not just edge algorithms.

## Highlights

- **[Heisenberg](https://github.com/SamBroomy/heisenberg)**: Complete offline location enrichment tool, using the geonames database to backfill and enrich location data.
- **[market-making](https://github.com/SamBroomy/market-making)**: System for ingesting live market data streams, replicating orderbooks locally, and distributing market data to message queues and time-series databases. Focused on engineering a market-making system from the ground up.
- **[ZK Sudoku prover](https://github.com/SamBroomy/zk-sudoku-prover)**: Verifying the correctness of Sudoku puzzles without ever revealing the puzzle solution itself. A simple rust base implementation of a Zero Knowledge Prover based on graph colouring.


## Interests

- Rust, async internals, atomics, locks, lower-level primitives
- Compilers & systems programming
- Building things from scratch
- Swimming, running, netball, gaming
- Learning deeply and broadly

## Looking for

Ideally: a role where I write and engineer in Rust.

Always trying to learn something new.
